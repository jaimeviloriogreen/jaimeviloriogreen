My software development skills is around web development with these tecnologies: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Node.js, Python with Flask and Jupyter Lab (Data Science). For a few days ago I have been trying to learn more deeply **Node.js** and **Vanilla JavaScript** in order to become a **JavaScript full developer**.
